//Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
//with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number,
//and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working,
//modify your program to print "FizzBuzz",
 //for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5
 //(and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
